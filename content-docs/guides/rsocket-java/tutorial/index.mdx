## Preface

We will be creating a chat application with a server and a client.

The chat client will have the following functionality:
- Private messages between users
- Joining and sending messages to channels
- Uploading/Downloading files
- Getting server and client statistics (e.g. number of channels)

Since the emphasis is on showcasing as much RSocket functionality as possible, some examples may be either a bit contrived, or
be possible to implement in a different way using RSocket. This is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Required knowledge

The guide assumes the following knowledge:

* Basic java level (classes/methods, threads, streams)
* Basic understanding of RSocket protocol (See [About RSocket](/about/faq))

## Required setup

TODO: setting up a java projects with rsocket as a dependency

## Code

The tutorial code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rsocket/rsocket-java) under <b>examples/tutorial</b>.
